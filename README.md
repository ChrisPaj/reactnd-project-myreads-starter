# MyReads Project

The MyReads Project is part of the Udacity Course react. Within the Project you find three book shelves (currently reading, want to read, read) with different bocks on them.
Each book offers a selection of status' (currently reading, want to read, read, none) to choose from.
Choosing a selection will move the bokk to the apropriate shelf or take it out (option none).

The bookshelf contains a link to a serach page, where defined expressions can be entered: [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md)
When entered, a list of max. 20 books appears. If any of these are on one of the the three bookshelves already, the correct shelf shows up, when clicking the book's option menu.
